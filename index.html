                        Agrarian reform is a complex and often controversial program which usually meets with opposition
                        especially from those with vested interests. The problems are known to be deeply rooted in
                        history. It is, therefore, a centuries-old problem. In the last eight or nine decades, the
                        Philippine government had legislated programs of agrarian reform. However, there has been a wide
                        gap between the declared objectives of such legislation and the actual realization. The
                        implementation of agrarian reforms proceeded at a very slow pace. This was due to many factors
                        like the lack of political will. While it is true that thousands of hectares have already been
                        redistributed to small farmers and until recently through President Duterte’s aggressive desire
                        to implement the CARP, in general, the redistribution of land is still very slow.

                        In the subsequent pages, salient points on agrarian policies in the Philippines since Spanish
                        era are presented. Try to notice some information that caused the problem and why until now land
                        dispute remains one of the social issues in the Philippine society.

                        Philippines remains an agricultural country. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood of the
                        Filipinos. In so many years, the agrarian system of Philippines was being controlled by the
                        large landlords. The small farmers in the Philippines were struggling for their rights to land
                        and other natural resources. In colonial times, the Americans saw it as the main issue for
                        revolts in the Philippines. Americans have realized the needed reforms having seen the defects
                        in land ownership. One measure introduced by Americans to remedy the defects was by legislation.
                        The Philippine Commonwealth government followed this as policy makers recognized the importance
                        of laws in protecting the rights of the farmers. Since the 1930s, Philippine government has
                        instituted various land reforms, the most recent of which is the 1988 Comprehensive Agrarian
                        Reform Law (R.A 6657). While considerable swaths of land have been redistributed, the most
                        contentious private agricultural lands, which are also the most productive and fertile, remain
                        with wealthy private landowners (GOP (Philippine Statistics Authority) 2015; FAO 1997; Borras
                        and Franco 2007; Quizon and Pagsanghan 2014).

                    <p>The Second World War II started in Europe in 1939 and in the Pacific in 1941.</p>
                    <p>Hukbalahap controlled whole areas of Central Luzon; landlords who supported the Japanese lost
                        their lands to peasants while those who supported the Huks earned fixed rentals in favor of the
                        tenants.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the end of war also signaled the end of gains acquired by the peasants.</p>
                    <p>Upon the arrival of the Japanese in the Philippines in 1942, peasants and workers organizations
                        grew strength. Many peasants took up arms and identified themselves with the anti-Japanese
                        group, the HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon).</p>

                    <p>When the Spaniards came to the Philippines, the concept of encomienda (Royal Land Grants) was
                        introduced. This system grants that Encomienderos must defend his encomienda from external
                        attack, maintain peace and order within, and support the missionaries. In turn, the encomiendero
                        acquired the right to collect tribute from the indios (native).</p>
                    <p>The system, however, degenerated into abuse of power by the encomienderos The tribute soon became
                        land rents to a few powerful landlords. And the natives who once cultivated the lands in freedom
                        were transformed into mere share tenants.</p>
                    <p>The Torrens system, which the Americans instituted for the registration of lands, did not solve
                        the problem completely. Either they were not aware of the law or if they did, they could not pay
                        the survey cost and other fees required in applying for a Torrens title.</p>
                    <p>However, despite the existence of different classes in the social structure, practically everyone
                        had access to the fruits of the soil. Money was unknown, and rice served as the medium of
                        exchange.</p>
